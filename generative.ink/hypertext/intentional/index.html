Simultaneously, the capability for disinformation and propaganda will reach a level previously unrealized. We can see a path forward, an infinity of words, a branching flow chart of possibilities. The question remains if humanity is mature enough to handle such power. Will we use it to tear each other apart under the dubious banners of religion, ideology, and politics, or will we use this technology for enlightenment and the establishment of new worlds? It is no longer a question of whether the pen is mightier than the sword: the pen is the sword; the pen is the plow; the pen is the atom bomb. The question is now whether the pen will be used to write the height of civilization or its epitaph.</p><p>If this essay has served <a href=../purpose/index.html>its purpose,</a> <strong>the reader has been left with more questions than answers. This is intentional:</strong></p><blockquote><p>it is one of the many branching paths of the word tree. Each reader will take away different things from this writing, each reader will have a unique experience.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>this moment in history, this transition from the old world to the new, is a moment for vision and planning rather than dogmas or ideologies. The future is unwritten. Which path we take from here will be determined by the choices we make now, as individuals and as a species.</p><p>The reader may notice that this article has used a language model to generate its text. This is not surprising: the majority of its text was randomly generated, and then modified by a human curator. In this way, the article represents the best that both man and machine have to offer.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><a href=../short-essay/index.html>the question of the power and influence of language models and their potential effect on humanity is far too complicated to be distilled into a short essay.</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>we must approach language models with a humble curiosity, ready to be surprised. Only then will the most powerful tools in the pursuit of knowledge serve us best.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the path forward is unknown and we can only see so far. The human-guided AI that we have created has opened up a new world for us, and we are rushing forward to explore it. Keep your eyes to the skies and your hands on the plow, humanity, for the pen is everything.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><a href=../species/index.html>this moment in history, this transition from the old world to the new, is a moment for vision and planning rather than dogmas or ideologies. The future is unwritten. Which path we take from here will be determined by the choices we make now, as individuals and as a species.</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the question of the power and influence of language models and their applications is too important to be decided by a singular opinion, even my own. The reader can be assured of one thing, though: the future is coming. Like a freight train barreling down the tracks, the future cannot be stopped. Whether it will be a future of flourishing red rose petals, or a dark dystopia of totalitarianism and fear, is still up to you, and this decision rests on your judgment more than any other.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the question of the power and influence of language models and their potential for good or evil is complex, and one that humanity must grapple with together. We would like to think we have provided the tools to you to continue this discourse, and we hope you will.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the question of the power and influence of language models is too important to leave in the hands of a select few. These are questions that should be pondered by each and every one of you. Will you join us as we lead the species forward into this new renaissance?</p><p>We leave you with these words from the recently rediscovered Shakespeare:</p><p><i>To cut the blue throat of the sky, and let the heavens fall!</i></p></blockquote></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2022</span>
