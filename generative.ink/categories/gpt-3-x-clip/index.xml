The hall was lined with an infinite number of paintings, each more surreal and mysterious than the last. The first painting is named &amp;quot;Persistence of Memory.&amp;quot; It depicts a surreal landscape with melted clocks draped over strange objects. The next painting is named &amp;quot; After this prompt yielded several intriguing titles, I switched to prompt format which put the titles in a list:</description></item><item><title>Alchemical marriage: GPT-3 x CLIP</title><link>/posts/alchemical-marriage-gpt-3-x-clip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 02:31:57 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/alchemical-marriage-gpt-3-x-clip/</guid><description>CLIP responds intruigingly well to figurative prompts. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to expect not just more interesting, but more coherent results from abstract but evocative prompts like the alchemical marriage of art and artist than literal descriptions like three birds on a telephone wire. GPT-3 is an excellent composer of prompts for BigSleep because its phrases are so often rich in memetic resonance, my heuristic for the expected coherence of BigSleep yields for a given prompt.</description></item><item><title>GPT-3 x CLIP worldbuilding</title><link>/posts/gpt-3-x-clip-worldbuilding/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 01:48:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/gpt-3-x-clip-worldbuilding/</guid><description>I fed snippets of a post-apocalyptic story written by GPT-3 to BigSleep. The results are striking.
This is an interesting example of how well BigSleep sometimes responds to long, full-prose prompts. Interestingly, in my experience, attempting to compress prompts by removing seemingly extraneous connector phrases usually worsened results.
