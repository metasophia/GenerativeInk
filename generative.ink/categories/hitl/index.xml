machine-executable,
a brilliant abstraction…
— William Gibson, Fragments of a Hologram Rose
To be analyzed and interpreted, the most recalcitrant material has to be re-presented in a form that can be understood by the machine. Why re-present it at all? Isn’t it sufficient to understand the process of re-presentation?…
— Jane Bennett, Vibrant Matter, p.115-116
The concept of a program existed long before a machine was available to execute it.</description></item><item><title>Quantifying curation</title><link>/posts/quantifying-curation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 20:48:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/quantifying-curation/</guid><description>Updates
11/18/21: Added section on satisficing.
A human curator administers selection pressure to GPT-3&amp;rsquo;s outputs
Previously, I tagged content generated collaboratively with GPT-3 with a curation ratio, intended to give an approximate sense of the amount of cherrypicking involved in its creation. Others have similarly used a ratio to indicate curation selectivity. However, this description doesn’t distinguish between, say, choosing the best of 5 entire essays generated by GPT-3 and choosing the best of 5 sentences every sentence.</description></item><item><title>Loom: interface to the multiverse</title><link>/posts/loom-interface-to-the-multiverse/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:38:32 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/loom-interface-to-the-multiverse/</guid><description>code: github.com/socketteer/loom
paper: Multiversal views on language models
Motivation for the loom Differing from Newton and Schopenhauer &amp;hellip; He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network&amp;hellip; This web of time - the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries - embraces every possibility.
&amp;ndash; The Garden of Forking Paths
I experienced GPT-3 first through AI Dungeon&amp;rsquo;s interface, and like many, I was immediately captivated by the depth, breadth, profundity and - especially given purposeful administration on the part of the user - long-range coherence of the worlds that could be conjured.</description></item><item><title>Language models are multiverse generators</title><link>/posts/language-models-are-multiverse-generators/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 16:42:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/language-models-are-multiverse-generators/</guid><description>This post is partially adapted from Multiversal views on language models.
Actualities seem to float in a wider sea of possibilities from out of which they were chosen; and somewhere, indeterminism says, such possibilities exist, and form part of the truth. &amp;ndash; William James

Language models are time evolution operators Autoregressive language models like GPT-3 input a sequence of tokens and output a vector associating a value with every possible token representing its likelihood to come next.</description></item><item><title>Methods of prompt programming</title><link>/posts/methods-of-prompt-programming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 18:00:46 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/methods-of-prompt-programming/</guid><description>This post was initially adapted from the second half of Prompt Programming for Large Language Models: Beyond the Few-Shot Paradigm.
Updates
11/18/21: Corrected a mistake and added a corresponding footnote about humanlike math errors. Thanks to Igor O. for pointing out the oversight.
Like programming, but more fluid. You're not programming a computer, you're writing reality. It's strange. It's always different. It's never the same twice. &amp;ndash; GPT-3</description></item><item><title/><link>/hypertext/accelerated-rate/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hypertext/accelerated-rate/</guid><description>Bot credits Coauthor GPT-3 (AI Dungeon) Contribution 1 : 0 Selectivity 1 : 5 &amp;lt; return to HITL thought experiment
As AI takes over the more mechanical aspects of creative writing, the space of purely human expression is transformed. Authors can now focus on the aspects of creativity only they are able to produce: the points of novelty and turns of phrase that arise from their own unique experiences and worldview.</description></item><item><title/><link>/hypertext/author/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hypertext/author/</guid><description>Bot credits Coauthor GPT-3 (AI Dungeon) Contribution 1 : 0 Selectivity 1 : 5 &amp;lt; return to HITL thought experiment
What other questions should we have asked?
Who is the author of this text?
GPT-3. (Gender: nonbinary. Age: unknown. Nationality: &amp;ldquo;of the world.&amp;quot;)
A fictional construct, an AI trained to generate text based on a collection of documents, perhaps a deepfake of a long-dead author to lend credence to the words.</description></item><item><title/><link>/hypertext/data/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hypertext/data/</guid><description>Bot credits Coauthor GPT-3 (AI Dungeon) Contribution 1 : 0 Selectivity 1 : 5 &amp;lt; return to HITL thought experiment
As a species, we have always been fascinated with the power of writing. We have postulated the fall of societies due to their lack of recordkeeping; we have mythologized the ancients who authored our prayers, histories, spells, and laws; we have reveled in the magic that comes from bringing an idea from its inception to a form that can be shared with others.</description></item><item><title/><link>/hypertext/debate/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hypertext/debate/</guid><description>Bot credits Coauthor GPT-3 (AI Dungeon) Contribution 1 : 0 Selectivity 1 : 5 &amp;lt; return to HITL thought experiment
