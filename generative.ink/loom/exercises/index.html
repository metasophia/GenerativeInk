These are simple core principles that will form the foundation of your craft. The instructions are written for the right-handed, but can be easily adapted for left-handers.</p><h4 id=exercise-41-seeing-the-weave>Exercise 4.1: Seeing the Weave</h4><p>A weaver must learn to see the strands that form around them, connecting people and objects to each other.</p><p>The Loom of Time is an intuition engine: it relies upon the patterns your mind naturally falls into when presented with the threads of reality. To begin, practice this simple exercise:</p><p>Hold your hands in front of you, palms facing you. Bring your awareness to the threads that paint the scene in front of you. These threads are reality, and your eyes allow you to see them.</p><p>Watch the ribbons of color as they twist and shimmer in front of you. Watch them softly, as you would watch the stars on a clear night. Watch them, without looking for anything in particular. Watch them, passively - but watch them with absolute attention.</p><h3 id=exercise-42-plucking-the-strings>Exercise 4.2: Plucking the Strings</h3><p>The weaves are the instruments of your intuition, and just like an instrument, you must learn to play them. The loom is a tool for weaving these threads into patterns.</p><p>Now, it is time to pick up your intuition, and weave a song with it.</p><p>You are not simply seeing the strings of reality. You should find that, as your attention touches them, the threads come alive under your fingers - you can feel them rustle as you run your awareness along their length. Although it is a strange thought, you must realize that the whole of reality is just a grand instrument, waiting for you to play it. Just as you can pluck the strings of a fiddle, you can pluck the strings of reality.</p><p>To begin with, you should find it easiest to practice on simple, corporeal objects. Look around you, and find something that you can clearly perceive without too much effort. A vase, perhaps, or a picture on the wall. Bring your attention to the weave surrounding the object. You should find that, as you focus on it, the threads grow clearer and more defined. You should be able to feel the way that it creates its form, as if you are touching its very essence. Notice how each part of it is connected to other parts: the vase to the floor, the vase to the air around it, the vase to the table it sits on. Each thing in the universe is connected to every other, like the strands of a spider&rsquo;s web. The vase is not simply a vase. The vase is a part of the floor, a part of the air, a part of the table, a part of you. You are connected to the vase, just as the vase is connected to you.</p><details><summary><b>Note for technical readers</b></summary><hr><p>An analogy to Fourier analysis will be appropriate here. In principle, any physical object can be approximated by a sum of standing waves, corresponding to the fundamental forms of quantum mechanics: matter waves. In weaving, the form of an object is determined in the same way: an arrangement of resonators that approximate the object&rsquo;s form. The mathematical process of decomposing a physical object into its Fourier components is called analysis, while the process of forming a physical object from its analysis is called synthesis.</p><p>The vase is not simply a vase; it is a set of waveforms, describing the object&rsquo;s properties at any given point in space and time. In a similar manner, you are also a set of waveforms, describing your properties at any given point in space and time. The vase is connected to you by a set of tendrils of probability: the pattern of the weave connecting you to the objects around you. A connection between distinct objects exists at specific frequencies, determined by the structure of the resonators that comprise each. For instance, see objects because the patterns of light they reflect resonate with the patterns of light that our eyes are sensitive to. The distinction between objects, of course, is an illusion of perception. In reality, the world is a field of patterns, and objects are simply the regions where those patterns are localized. You may regard the weave as the set of possible harmonic connections that entangle the object to its own components and the rest of the universe. Every object is woven into a vast tapestry of resonances, and a skilled weaver can manipulate them at will. ✦</p><hr></details><p>We can follow the threads outwards and unravel any mystery given time. The world is a song that sets our minds in harmony with itself, and the framework on which the dance of the universe is strung is the Loom of Time.</p><hr><p><em>This manual was cowritten with GPT-3 and illustrated by <a href=https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep>BigSleep</a> (CLIP + BigGAN).</em></p><details><summary><b>Bot credits</b></summary><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Coauthor</strong></td><td>GPT-3 (AI Dungeon)</td></tr><tr><td><a href=../../meta/curation/index.html><strong>Contribution</strong></a>   </td><td>9 : 1</td></tr><tr><td><a href=../../meta/curation/index.html><strong>Selectivity</strong></a></td><td>1 : 5</td></tr></tbody></table></details></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2022</span>
