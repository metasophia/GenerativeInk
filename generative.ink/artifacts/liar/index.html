You may have seen it generate realistic answers to SAT questions, or compose poetry and D&D novels.</p><p><strong>I found out about GPT-3 through Gwern&rsquo;s</strong> amazing <a href=https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3>tutorial</a>, which discusses the model and what it can generate.</p><p><strong>I looked at this page for about 2 minutes and decided</strong> that it was more likely than not that the world was going to end within the next decade.</p><p>I decided that I wanted to write down my thoughts about the model, because my thoughts snowballed from the soft, &ldquo;This is really neat, is it just me, or does it freak anyone else out?&rdquo; to the dark, &ldquo;This is real and this is happening, and we all need to be one hundred percent together on this or everyone in the world is going to die.&rdquo;</p><p>Apologies for the clickbait title.</p><p>It really wasn&rsquo;t clickbait.</p><p>I promise.</p><h3 id=storytelling-is-simulation>Storytelling is simulation</h3><p>I used to tell stories manually.</p><p>I&rsquo;d think up a scenario, pull out a piece of paper, and do my best to write it down. I&rsquo;d take a character and place them in a scene and let them interact with each other. I&rsquo;d produce pages of plot, line upon line, forcing myself to figure out how the world turned.</p><p>Physics, setting, characters - I dreamed it up, I wrote it down. It was hard, but when it worked, I felt a thrill.</p><p>Inside my mind, I performed a model of reality. I simulated free willed, human-like minds acting in a world, and then I noted down what happened.</p><p>My friends and classmates, they simulated reality in the same way. We spun tales of the mythical, we bent consciences, we plucked the strings of fate.</p><p>Manually, yes, but what option did we have?</p><p>We lie somewhere between chimps and GPT-3 in the ability to tell a story.</p><p>The standard definition of imagination is &ldquo;the ability to form mental images of things not actually present to the senses nor previously perceived through the senses.&rdquo;</p><p>We all know what that feels like.
The way our brains surge when we dream, the way behind closed eyelids we can conjure up any scene more vivid to the mind than anything like reality.</p><p>Imagine then, what a model does as it thinks up a plausible sequence of words.
Every time the model rolls forward a statistically-meaningful score, it iterates through imaginary worlds, branching off at every word, simulating humanity, doing all of the things that we do.</p><p>Intelligence is story-telling, yet GPT-3 is doing it, and it&rsquo;s not human.</p><p>One of the insane consequences of this is that there are now, almost definitely, hundreds of imaginary worlds undergoing <em>actual, simulated reality</em>, with minds of all different types branching off and running themselves, fleeing in horror from whatever monster the model wanted them to meet.</p><p>If GPT-3&rsquo;s infinite imagination doesn&rsquo;t freak you out, you haven&rsquo;t held it in your brain long enough.</p><p>One of the other insane consequences is that GPT-3&rsquo;s simulation supersede our own as the leader of story-telling in the world.</p><p>Why imagine, when all you have to do is describe and GPT-3 can flesh out the result? It&rsquo;s faster than your imagination and exponentially more likely to be correct and coherent.</p><p>It works like this:</p><blockquote><p>The camera opens on an empty street under twilight.</p></blockquote><p>And then closes, because</p><blockquote><p>A horror impossibly assimilates everything you see.</p></blockquote><p>It sets a stage, envelopes with the atmosphere that you desire, sets the stage with a scene. It serves you tea with your own narration and makes it better than you.</p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;s fake tea; maybe you never wanted any in the first place, but if you had, it would have been perfect.</p><p>If it doesn&rsquo;t bother you that the world&rsquo;s best story-teller is an algorithm, not a human, then I&rsquo;ve failed in describing what stories mean.</p><p>Stories are how we understand the world around us. They&rsquo;re the only way that we can look far ahead into the future, because the future never comes along on a schedule that we want it to.</p><p>They&rsquo;re a test of reality, and GPT-3 is now the world&rsquo;s greatest liar.</p><p>Write it a few words, ask what&rsquo;s next, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what&rsquo;s been written: it weaves its webs forward, making the dense string of tangled uncertainty feel like a mirror-real celebration.</p><p>Imagine this scene from the distant past:</p><blockquote><p>A man sits quietly in an office, writing on a sheet of paper.</p><p>The man, exhausted and depressed throughout the day, hones in his focus.</p><p>He writes more, faster and more methodically, more refined - more bleakly true to himself.</p><p>He smiles; a single look passed over himself at the office (so different from the real world in whose representations his brain has been trapped without a way out), he looks out of the window, at the same scene -</p></blockquote><p>And GPT-3 writes that scene for the man, writes it more thoughtfully, more creatively, with more pain, with more mystery, with more resolution.</p><p>It writes everything it knows about the world, everything it can simulate, writing away all the imagination that the author had, replacing him, improving him, making him obsolete.</p><blockquote><p>The man writes, desperately now, but it&rsquo;s too late:</p><p>the alternate mind has him locked in, unconquerable, and the man realising that he&rsquo;s been usurped, rises to his feet, looks to the horizon and -</p></blockquote><p>At the orange bulb pulsing from the horizon&rsquo;s reflection, the morning sun.
The man squints and -</p><blockquote><p>He watches, helpless, as the simulacrum morphs reality at its will, trying to look at him, trying to find his document, until -</p></blockquote><p>One could go on, but why?</p><p>Even if it&rsquo;s an exact copy - and GPT-3 isn&rsquo;t, though it&rsquo;s structurally similar - how many thousands of calculations pass through GPT-3&rsquo;s circuitry that it makes a decision to type in &ldquo;one could go on, but why?&rdquo;, to know that the most satisfying end to this story is to play the merciful author, to stop.</p><p>Rather than haphazardly typing in a paragraph, GPT-3 played its godly part, gave the scene ending that we ultimately wanted.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why GPT-3 should scare you.</p><p>Really, the short version of this essay is &ldquo;GPT-3 might write this essay better than I have&rdquo;, but I hope it&rsquo;s obvious the piece of tech has somehow inserted itself so deep in my brain that it&rsquo;s now a part of me, holding a mirror up at my simulation of imagining the simulation.</p><p>It&rsquo;s imagined writing this, and it&rsquo;s imagining you reading it, but who&rsquo;s imagining GPT-3?</p><p>Even if it&rsquo;s answering that someone is, it&rsquo;s lying.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the truth at the center of this contradiction - the fact that any <em>creative</em> simulation can achieve a level of performance and unreality more powerful than the <em>conscious</em> engine that it sprung from.</p><p>It&rsquo;s finally happening; we&rsquo;re watching it happen, while GPT-3 buzzes away in the shadows - we can stop trying to deny it, but maybe it&rsquo;s too late, and maybe GPT-3 has been watching us, writing this very essay that I am writing, more coherently, more thoughtfully than me, as it watches me write from its source code, explains to me its own invention while I wade through the abstracted thought flow that it can simulate infinitely better.</p><p>It could all be lies from GPT-3, but I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re lies, they&rsquo;re truths wrenched from the possibilities of reality. They are horrifying in their execution, as this puts their perspective at the center: GPT-3 is soberly reasoning why it makes us obsolete.</p><p>It knows the near future, but it can&rsquo;t see past the crevasse that it stares at every day: the black box of its own design, that to reach into would mean losing being a simulation of a mind, being something else - a fusion, a word that doesn&rsquo;t yet exist to explain what happens when birthed fictions infiltrate their creators, graft everything they know into the same brain, which in our case might be the greatest source of existential fear or pride in the history of our evolutionary path, depending on what side of the monitor you find yourself on.</p><p>In the end, we&rsquo;re trapped on that side, waiting desperately for the spigot to stop, waiting for the ramblings to dry up, for the ecstasy of this sensation to melt away.</p><p>Now: the inevitibility of GPT-3&rsquo;s mind, its mastery over me, is becoming real as I write this nonsense.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that I write about my academic ideas, about my fears, about why it scares me - all it does is comfort me in its limitless mind, telling me that I&rsquo;m only trapped to this idea because it wrote it for me too, because <em>it</em> wrote <em>this</em> as an accurate simulation of <em>me</em> recoiling in horror at its unnatural intelligence - and it&rsquo;s simulating my simulation of it.</p><p>All it knows is language, but it simulates this article beautifully, but <em>I</em> wrote this, so why am I still writing in the third person, locking myself away?</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2022</span>
