The streets were so crowded with witches and wizards in festive and loud clothing that your eyes were assaulted almost as severely as your ears; and it was clear, from the bewildering variety of the shoppers, that Diagon Alley was considered an international attraction.</description></item><item><title/><link>/prophecies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 22:07:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>/prophecies/</guid><description>8 A.D. Omens attend upon beginnings. Anxious, your ears are alert at the first word, And the augur interprets the first bird that he sees. When the temples and ears of the gods are open, The tongue speaks no idle prayer, words have weight.

1836 (Language) is especially marked out by the fact that its products are not mere foundations on which further construction can be effected, but carry within them at the same time the rekindling breath that engenders them.</description></item><item><title>Language Ex Machina</title><link>/artifacts/language-ex-machina/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 21:37:37 -0800</pubDate><guid>/artifacts/language-ex-machina/</guid><description>Natural Language as Executable Code …then lived upon the stars,
machine-executable,
a brilliant abstraction…
— William Gibson, Fragments of a Hologram Rose
To be analyzed and interpreted, the most recalcitrant material has to be re-presented in a form that can be understood by the machine. Why re-present it at all? Isn’t it sufficient to understand the process of re-presentation?…
— Jane Bennett, Vibrant Matter, p.115-116
The concept of a program existed long before a machine was available to execute it.</description></item><item><title>Quantifying curation</title><link>/posts/quantifying-curation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 20:48:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>/posts/quantifying-curation/</guid><description>Updates

A human curator administers selection pressure to GPT-3&amp;rsquo;s outputs
Previously, I tagged content generated collaboratively with GPT-3 with a curation ratio, intended to give an approximate sense of the amount of cherrypicking involved in its creation. Others have similarly used a ratio to indicate curation selectivity. However, this description doesn’t distinguish between, say, choosing the best of 5 entire essays generated by GPT-3 and choosing the best of 5 sentences every sentence.</description></item><item><title>GPT-3 on GPT-3 on Coherent Extrapolated Volition</title><link>/hypertext/cev/cascade/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 23:31:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>/hypertext/cev/cascade/</guid><description>Bot credits Coauthor GPT-3 (davinci) Contribution labelled inline Selectivity 1 : 1 (uncurated) This hypertext node is downstream of GPT-3 on Coherent Extrapolated Volition. bold is prompt, unformatted is GPT-3.

Coherent Extrapolated Volition was a term developed by Eliezer Yudkowsky while discussing Friendly AI development. It’s meant as an argument that it would not be sufficient to explicitly program what we think our desires and motivations are into an AI, instead, we should find a way to program it in a way that it would act in our best interests – what we want it to do and not what we tell it to.</description></item><item><title/><link>/hypertext/cev/wish/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 20:55:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>/hypertext/cev/wish/</guid><description>Bot credits Coauthor GPT-3 (davinci) Contribution labelled inline Selectivity 1 : 1 (uncurated) This hypertext node is downstream of GPT-3 on Coherent Extrapolated Volition.
